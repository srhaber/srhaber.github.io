[Verse]
D                        A             G                D
Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
D               A                  G    D
Talkin' to some rich folk that you know
D                         A        G           D
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
D                      A         G    D
Well, you know I could never be alone

[Chorus]
        A                          D
Take me down little Susie, take me down
A                                             D
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
            G                          D
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
G                           D
Send me dead flowers by the mail
G                          D
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
D                         A             G     D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

[Verse]
D                        A            G              D
Well when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac
D                A            G   D
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
D                          A           G            D
Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
D                   A             G   D
And another girl to take my pain away

[Chorus]
Take me down little Susie, take me down...

[Solo Verse]

[Chorus]
Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
G                                D
Send me dead flowers by the U.S. Mail
G                              D
Say it with dead flowers in my wedding
D                         A             G     D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
No, I won't forget to put roses on your grave
